In this project, I implement 3 versions of a neural network with one hidden layer and a softmax output layer
using (1) NumPy, (2) PyTorch with autograd, and (3) PyTorch with the torch.nn and
torch.optim modules. I evaluate the 3 implementations on the same two 2D non-linear classification tasks. Please view the **Implementation** section in the *feedforward-nn.pdf* file for assignment details.
