In this project, I implement two versions of sparse Autoencoders using Numpy and Pytorch respectively to evaluate natural images and MNIST digits. I also implement Principal Component Analysis. Please view the **Implementation** section in the *autoencoder-pca.pdf* file for project details. 

2 Implementation (250 points)
Download the skeleton code from http://ace.cs.ohio.edu/~razvan/courses/dl6900/hw/hw03.zip.
Implement two versions of the sparse autoencoder in Python, using (1) NumPy and (2)
PyTorch in the corresponding folders, and evaluate them on natural images (-t natural)
and MNIST digits (-t digits). Implement also the PCA, PCA whitening, and ZCA whitening,
following the steps explained in this section. Write code only in the les indicated
in bold. Make sure that you organize your code in folders as shown in Table 1 below.
For the sparse AE exercise, the visualization of the hidden units should be saved in the
jpg les listed in the table. For the PCA exercise, save each gure displayed by the code
into a jpg le figure xx.jpg. The rst part of the exercise should generate 6 gures
figure 01.jpg to figure 06.jpg, whereas the second part of the exercise should generate
5 gures figure 07.jpg to figure 11.jpg.
